00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,120
This program is brought to you by Stanford University.

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,980
Please visit us at stanford.edu.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,620
Thank you.

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,900
I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.

5
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:45,120
Truth be told, I never graduated from college and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.

6
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,560
Today I want to tell you three stories from my life.

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
That's it.

8
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,480
No big deal.

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,960
Just three stories.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,540
The first story is about connecting the dots.

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,800
I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,260
So why'd I drop out?

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,540
It started before I was born.

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,900
My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for a adoption.

15
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:30,400
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,140
Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.

17
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,980
So my parents who were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking, we've got an unexpected baby boy.

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,360
Do you want him?

19
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,640
They said, of course.

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,940
My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school.

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,580
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.

22
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,040
She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college.

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,360
This was the start in my life.

24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,340
And 17 years later I did go to college.

25
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,100
But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford.

26
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,220
And all of my working class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,020
After six months I couldn't see the value in it.

28
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,940
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.

29
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,440
And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.

30
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,280
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay.

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,920
It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

32
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:03,000
The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

33
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,600
It wasn't all romantic.

34
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,420
I didn't have a dorm room so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms.

35
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,860
I returned Coke bottles for the five cent deposits to buy food with.

36
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,700
And I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,660
I loved it.

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,280
And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.

39
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,080
Let me give you one example.

40
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,420
Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.

41
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,360
Throughout the campus, every poster, every label on every drawer was beautifully hand-caligraphed.

42
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:52,100
Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.

43
00:03:52,740 --> 00:04:01,820
I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great.

44
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,560
It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture.

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
And I found it fascinating.

46
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,840
None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.

47
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,720
But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.

48
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,300
And we designed it all into the Mac.

49
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,220
It was the first computer with beautiful typography.

50
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,380
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.

51
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,600
And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.

52
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,560
If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class.

53
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,240
And personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.

54
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,020
Of course, it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college.

55
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,000
But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.

56
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,540
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward.

57
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,800
You can only connect them looking backwards.

58
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,800
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

59
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,680
You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

60
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:29,920
Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path.

61
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,880
And that will make all the difference.

62
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,580
My second story is about love and loss.

63
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,260
I was lucky. I found what I loved to do early in life.

64
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,800
Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20.

65
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,920
We worked hard, and in ten years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees.

66
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,540
We just released our finest creation, the Macintosh, a year earlier, and I just turned 30.

67
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,860
And then I got fired.

68
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,680
How can you get fired from a company you started?

69
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,900
Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me.

70
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,160
And for the first year or so, things went well.

71
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,620
But then our visions of the future began to diverge, and eventually we had a falling out.

72
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,920
When we did, our board of directors sided with him.

73
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,060
And so at 30, I was out, and very publicly out.

74
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,800
What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.

75
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,800
I really didn't know what to do for a few months.

76
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,760
I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.

77
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,900
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.

78
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,260
I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley.

79
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,320
But something slowly began to dawn on me.

80
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,880
I still loved what I did.

81
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,000
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.

82
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,180
I'd been rejected, but I was still in love.

83
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,060
And so I decided to start over.

84
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,700
I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.

85
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,760
The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.

86
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,200
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

87
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:38,260
During the next five years, I started a company named Next, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.

88
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:47,000
Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

89
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:58,420
In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought Next, and I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at Next is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.

90
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,980
And Laureen and I have a wonderful family together.

91
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,940
I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.

92
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,000
It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

93
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,620
Sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.

94
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,180
I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.

95
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,560
You've got to find what you love, and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers.

96
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:37,900
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work, and the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

97
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,300
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking, and don't settle.

98
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,360
As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

99
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,200
And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

100
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,900
So keep looking. Don't settle.

101
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,260
My third story is about death.

102
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:17,100
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like, If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.

103
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:32,760
It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, if today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?

104
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,700
And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

105
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:46,360
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

106
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:59,380
Because almost everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure, these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

107
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:06,800
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

108
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,660
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

109
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,320
About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer.

110
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,000
I had a scan at 7.30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.

111
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,500
I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

112
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:33,920
The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.

113
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:42,240
My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctors' code for prepare to die.

114
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,520
It means to try and tell your kids everything.

115
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,160
You thought you'd have the next ten years to tell them in just a few months.

116
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,040
It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.

117
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,420
It means to say your goodbyes.

118
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,580
I live with that diagnosis all day.

119
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:13,720
Later that evening, I had a biopsy where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, threw my stomach into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.

120
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:27,420
I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope, the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.

121
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,400
I had the surgery, and thankfully, I'm fine now.

122
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:45,300
This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.

123
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:53,400
Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept.

124
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,580
No one wants to die.

125
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,560
Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.

126
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,720
And yet, death is the destination we all share.

127
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,040
No one has ever escaped it.

128
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,400
And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life.

129
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,640
It's life's change agent.

130
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,940
It clears out the old to make way for the new.

131
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,820
Right now, the new is you.

132
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,540
But someday, not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.

133
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,340
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.

134
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,200
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.

135
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,380
Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

136
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,720
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

137
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,100
And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

138
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,220
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

139
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,020
Everything else is secondary.

140
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:16,600
When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the Bibles of my generation.

141
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,580
It was created by a fellow named Stuart Brand, not far from here in Menlo Park.

142
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,320
And he brought it to life with his poetic touch.

143
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,040
This was in the late 60s, before personal computers and desktop publishing.

144
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,040
So it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras.

145
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,320
It was sort of like Google in paperback form 35 years before Google came along.

146
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,320
It was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools, and great notions.

147
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,580
Stuart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog.

148
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,820
And then, when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.

149
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,840
It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.

150
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:06,880
On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.

151
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,140
Beneath it were the words, Stay hungry, stay foolish.

152
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,460
It was their farewell message as they signed off.

153
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,440
Stay hungry, stay foolish.

154
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,580
And I have always wished that for myself.

155
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,360
And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

156
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,080
Stay hungry, stay foolish.

157
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,040
Thank you all very much.

158
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,960
Thank you.
