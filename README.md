# Lingua Player

Lingua Player is a web-based application designed for language learners. It allows users to upload an audio file (.mp3) and its corresponding subtitle file (.srt) to facilitate sentence-by-sentence playback. This feature helps users to focus on individual sentences, improving their listening comprehension and pronunciation.

## Core Features:

- **File Upload**: Users can upload .mp3 and .srt files.
- **Sentence-by-Sentence Playback**: The audio is played sentence by sentence, synchronized with the .srt file.
- **Playback Controls**: Intuitive controls are provided to navigate between sentences ('previous', 'current', and 'next').
