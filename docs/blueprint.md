# **App Name**: Lingua Player

## Core Features:

- File Upload: Allow users to upload .mp3 and .srt files.
- Sentence-by-Sentence Playback: Play the audio file sentence by sentence based on the .srt file.
- Playback Controls: Provide 'previous sentence', 'current sentence', and 'next sentence' buttons.
- Sentence History: Display the list of sentences in a sheet component (`sheet.tsx`) for easy review.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#90AFC5) to evoke a calm and focused learning environment.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F4F8), almost white, to minimize distraction.
- Accent color: Muted green (#A2D149), analogous to blue, for interactive elements and to indicate progress.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used for both headlines and body text due to its modern and neutral look that suits focused learning.
- Simple, clear icons for playback controls (previous, current, next).
- Clean and intuitive layout with clear separation of file upload area, playback controls, and sentence display.
- Subtle highlighting or progress bar to indicate the currently playing sentence.
